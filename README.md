**Type**: Individual

Create two sets of files in at least these formats: text, xml, yaml, json, csv. You decide the content (but avoid any personal data).

Data parsing is the act of reading data (in this case files) into a program. You have suceeded when you can print them out as a data structure in your programming language.

You are free to use libraries to help you parse the files into data types that make sense in the respective language.
